## Books
There are some great materials out there for you and we have gathered some of the best below. If books are your thing, you'll prabably want to start with "Mastering Bitcoin." This will give you some interesting history and teach you everything you need to know about Bitcoin.

You can then follow this up with "Mastering Ethereum". As a Dapp developer specifically, you will need to know about smart contracts and the EVM. This will not only teach you about Ethereum but also many of the concepts you will need for developing on other chains.
